              Currently working in Industrial Temporary and Permanent
              Recruitment and approching my 10th year. I have always had an
              interest in all things IT and regularly get called the "IT
              department". I basically just check for updates and turn things
              off and on again as Roy from the IT Crowd always suggests needs to
              be done. Started building my own PC's just before covid lockdown
              began which really got my computer and IT knowledge juices flowing
              which is how I ended up enrolling on this course now. All my
              knowledge is completely self-taught apart from the knowledge
              gained in this course.
